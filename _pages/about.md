I am currently pursuing a master's degree in Data Science at ETH Zurich. 
I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Telematics Engineering from Instituto Politecnico Nacional (IPN), Mexico. 

I am interested in building safe and trustworthy machine learning systems. I am specially interested in NLP applications.
