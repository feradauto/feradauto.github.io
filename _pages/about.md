I am currently pursuing a master's degree in Data Science at ETH Zurich. 
I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Telematics Engineering from Instituto Politecnico Nacional (IPN), Mexico. 

I am interested in building safe and trustworthy AI systems with special interest in natural language procesing applications. Iâ€™ve also worked as a data scientist at OPI Analytics in Mexico City.
